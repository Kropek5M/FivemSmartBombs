Hey, I would like to take pleasure in showing you the smart explosive system. There are 8 smart explosive counters in the script. 

1- The charge that explodes after the player gets into the car of the trap.

2- A charge that explodes after the player reaches the designated speed.

3- A charge that explodes after the vehicle does not travel at the designated speed

4- A load that will explode after the vehicle has a collision of some kind

5- Remote-controlled long-range cargo

6- Medium-range remote-controlled payload

7- Low-range remote-controlled payload

8- Remote-controlled cargo of unlimited range ( SIM SIGNAL )

The script is regularly updated with new features.  The optimization of the script is at the top level --> delay of 00.01ms. After purchasing the script, the buyer gets help with installation, support in case of questions, and in case of problems the support team is available 24/7.
